Soon after the Swan-Thing found life in an inflatable form. Its elegant neck has extended up to 13 metres tall in various installations internationally, but here we present the more modest 90cm tall version, created by our friends Third Drawer Down. Enjoy the Ridiculous Inflatable Swan-Thing as a toy, a pool float or as an inflatable sculpture placed in your home. Definitely not a life-saving device.",

Our teapots are handmade in England using the traditional method of fine bone china production.

Inside David Shrigley's specially designed wrapper is a bespoke chocolate recipe crafted especially for Shrig Shop - three cacao beans from Central America have been perfectly blended - Indio Rojo, Chuno and Nicaliso - to create a smooth and strong chocolate flavour with flowery and red berry notes culminating in a lingering wine acidity. Friis Holm work directly with independent cacao farmers to source the highest quality beans for the best tasting chocolate possible. To ensure quality and fair trade, farmers are paid considerably more for their beans than by standard industry buyers, including “fair trade” branded products, enabling the production of organic, sustainable, delicious chocolate. Buy a single bar, or in multiples of three or six.",
